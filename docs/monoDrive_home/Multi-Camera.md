- **hdmi_streaming**: A boolean representing whether the camera data gets streamed the HDMI, or the default of TCP.
- **stream_dimensions**: The dimensions of which the stream will stream over TCP.
  - *x*: The x dimension.
  - *y*: The y dimension.
- **camera_ids**: An array of strings that representing the ids of the cameras that are to be streamed through the multi camera.

## Output Data
See [base sensor](Common.md) for examples on how to get the sensor. All data that comes from sensor queues is a dictionary.

`data_camera= camera.get_message()`

### Parsed Camera Data Dictionary Keys and Values.

- **time_stamp (int):** Timestamp representing milliseconds since Sunday.
- **game_time (float):** Current game time of simulator, this value will be more prominent.
- **image (List<List<float<float>>>):** A 3D list that represents a single image following the format of **stream_dimensions_x** x **stream_dimensions_y** x 4
