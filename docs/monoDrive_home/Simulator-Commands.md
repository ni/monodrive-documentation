## Simulator Configuration
Used to configure a simulator session. This command includes the settings associated with the simulator session following the execution of the command and applies to all future sessions until the command is run again.

	`simulator configuration mode = (0, 1, or 2)`  if the configure command was successful, or `invalid map specified` if an invalid map is requested


## Spawn Ego Vehicle
Spawns the EGO vehicle using the supplied configuration. This command applies only to closed loop simulations.

 - **Command ID:  "SpawnVehicleCommand_ID"**

 - **Command Data**: [vehicle_config](Vehicle-Configuration.md)
	- For more information on these values:
		- [Vehicle body type & color](Vehicle-Configuration.md)

## Update Command
Update the state of the ego and other actors in the scene based on the message.   

- **Command ID:**  **"UpdateStateCommand_ID"**

- **Command Data**: Frame information for the ego vehicle and other actors.

- **Response**: (string)
	- `complete` if the simulation was updated properly.

## Torque Command
Control vehicle applying torque and steering angle to each wheel on the vehicle.

	- Torque applied to brake for each wheel (N*cm)
	- Torque values for each wheel (N*cm)
	- Steering angle (radians)   
- **Response**: (string)
	- `complete` if the simulation was updated properly.


## Weather Configuration
Configures the weather used in the simulation run. The profiles parameter is optional, and if present, the profiles are added or modified based on the supplied parameters for each profile.

 - **Command ID:  "WeatherConfig"**

 - **Command Data**: [weather_config](Weather.md)

 - **Response**: (string)

	- `DynamicWeather is not available` if the weather actor is missing from the map
	- `Weather configuration failed` if the weather profiles are invalid or mal-formed
