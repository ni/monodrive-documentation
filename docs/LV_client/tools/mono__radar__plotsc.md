- **Radar GT:** The radar cluster sample for the Ground Truth.
- **Radar:** The monoDrive radar cluster sample.
- **error in (Error Cluster):** Can accept error information wired from VIs previously called. Use this information to decide if any functionality should be bypassed in the event of errors from other VIs.
