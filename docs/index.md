We are excited to announce that monoDrive is now NI, [see Press Release](https://www.ni.com/en-us/about-ni/newsroom/news-releases/ni-acquires-monodrive-to-accelerate-autonomous-vehicle-developme.html).

This home page contains an index with a brief description of the different sections in the documentation. 

The documentation reflects the newest version of the monoDrive Simulation and Scenario Editor with Unreal Engine 4.25.4. We are excited to share our new features including a [Scenario Tool Widget](scenario_editor/scenarios.md) to easily load and save scenario files to run in Closed Loop mode, enhanced streaming, a new mode-Closed Loop Fixed Time Step, and new/updated sensors- a [waypoint sensor](monoDrive_home/Waypoint-Sensor.md) and [fisheye & wide angle lens camera models](monoDrive_home/Camera.md).

monoDrive's Platform is available now: [Download monoDrive](https://www.monodrive.io/register)
