# Weather

## monoDrive Dynamic Weather 

The monoDrive Simulator supports dynamic weather conditions that change the
visual and physical effects of the simulation. Pre-made weather profiles are
available in all of the monoDrive client versions which can be sent to 
the simulator to configure the current weather conditions. Additionally, the
monoDrive Scenario Editor provides an interactive way of changing weather 
conditions and saving them to configuration files.

## Adding Weather to a Map

In the monoDrive Scenario Editor, the "Weather" actor can be found in any one of
the pre-made monoDrive Unreal Engine maps found in the `Content/Maps` directory.
The Weather actor can be added to custom maps easily by searching for the Actor 
in the "Modes" window as shown in the image below. Simply drag the actor into 
the custom map and it should now appear in the "World Outliner".

<p class="img_container">
  <img class="lg_img" src="../img/modes_weather_actor.png" />
</p>

The weather also references the wind actor and the fog actor. Simply add these
two actors anywhere in the map the same as the weather actor.

<p class="img_container">
  <img class="lg_img" src="../img/wind_actor.png" />
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="img_container">
  <img class="lg_img" src="../img/fog_actor.png" />
</p>

The final step to getting the weather functioning is to set the map's light 
source to movable. This will allow the weather to control the lighting. Find the 
"Light Source" in the "World Outliner" and in the "Details" window, set the 
"Mobility" to movable as shown in  the image below:

<p class="img_container">
  <img class="lg_img" src="../img/movable_light_source.png" />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

## Configuring Weather Profiles

To find the Weather Actor in the map, first go to the "World Outliner" window
and search for "weather" in the search box. The Weather Actor should appear as
shown in the image below. 

<p class="img_container">
  <img class="lg_img" src="../img/world_outliner_weather.png" />
</p>

Clicking on the Weather Actor in "World Outliner" should bring up the "Details"
window for the Actor. Scroll down to the "Weather Description" in the "Details"
window to find the weather settings pictured below.

<p class="img_container">
  <img class="lg_img" src="../img/details_weather_actor.png" />
</p>

* **Load File Button:** Loads the current weather profile from the Profile Name 
in file specified in the "File Name" field.
* **Save File Button:** Saves the current weather profile to the file specified 
in the "File Name" field. If the profile already existed in the file, it will be 
updated with the current values. When saved, both this `.ini` file and a `.json` 
file will be saved for use with the simulator and client.
* **Configuration File Name:** The name of the `.ini` file to save the current
profile to. 
* **Profile Name:** Located in the Name field under the Weather settings,
specifies the human readable name of the weather profile to save to.

### Importing Weather in CARLA Format

The monoDrive Weather can be easily imported from CARLA settings by putting 
the desired profile into the 
`<VehicleAI Install Directory>\VehicleAI_Editor\Config\CarlaWeather.ini` file.
This file is used to load the initial weather profiles into the simulator so
they can be edited in the weather settings. The contents of a profile in `.ini`
should look similar to the following:

```ini
[MyCoolNewProfile]
SunPolarAngle=44.586
SunAzimuthAngle=174
SunBrightness=0
SunDirectionalLightIntensity=20
SunDirectionalLightColor=(R=255.000000,G=255.000000,B=255.000000,A=1.000000)
SunIndirectLightIntensity=16.6
CloudOpacity=14.28
HorizontFalloff=20
ZenithColor=(R=0.034046,G=0.109247,B=0.295000,A=1.000000)
HorizonColor=(R=1.979559,G=2.586644,B=3.000000,A=1.000000)
CloudColor=(R=0.855778,G=0.919020,B=1.000000,A=1.000000)
OverallSkyColor=(R=1.000000,G=1.000000,B=1.000000,A=1.000000)
SkyLightIntensity=4
SkyLightColor=(R=247.000000,G=240.000000,B=225.000000,A=255.000000)
bPrecipitation=False
PrecipitationType=Rain
PrecipitationAmount=0
PrecipitationAccumulation=0
bWind=True
WindIntensity=10
WindAngle=0
bOverrideCameraPostProcessParameters=True
CameraPostProcessParameters.AutoExposureMethod=Histogram
CameraPostProcessParameters.AutoExposureMinBrightness=0.27
CameraPostProcessParameters.AutoExposureMaxBrightness=5
CameraPostProcessParameters.AutoExposureBias=-3.5
```
<p>&nbsp;</p>

### Saving Weather Profiles

The default configuration file for the simulator is `CarlaWeather.ini` and comes 
with the shipped simulator. This file loads up several pre-determined weather 
profiles for editing in the Scenario Editor. These profiles can be edited in 
the Scenario Editor and saved out to a `.json` format that is usable in the
monoDrive clients.

After pressing the "Save File Button" pictured above, two files can be found
in the `Config` directory with the names specified in the 
"Configuration File Name" field. In the `.ini` file, the saved profile can 
be found under the specified "Profile Name" and appear as below:

In the `.json` file, the weather profile can be found in the JSON group where 
the `id` field matches the "Profile Name":

```json
{
      "id": "Default",
      "SunPolarAngle": 44.586,
      "SunAzimuthAngle": 174,
      "SunBrightness": 50,
      "SunDirectionalLightIntensity": 15.092,
      "SunDirectionalLightColor": {

      "bOverrideCameraPostProcessParameters": true,
      "CameraPostProcessParameters": {
        "AutoExposureMethod": "Histogram",
        "AutoExposureMinBrightness": 0.27,

        "AutoExposureBias": -3.5
      }
}
```

## Using Weather in the LabVIEW Client
For the LabVIEW client, the weather profiles that are exported can be pasted 
into the weather configuration (string control) located in the [mono_get_weather.vi](../LV_client/weather/mono_get_weather.md). 

After opening the VI's GUI: the weather profiles can be found on the right-hand
side of the interface. Simply copy and paste your custom JSON weather profile:

<p class="img_container">
  <img class="wide_img" src="../img/get_weather_vi.png" />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

## Using the Weather in the Python Client

The [monoDrive Python Client](../../python_client/quick_start) reads weather 
settings from input JSON files and sends them to the simulator. In the following 
example, simply place the desired weather configuration into the file 
`config/weather.json` and construct the simulator:

```python
 # Construct simulator from file
simulator = Simulator.from_file(
    config='./config/simulator_closed_loop.json',
    trajectory='./trajectories/Closed_Loop.json',
    sensors='./config/all_sensors.json',
    weather='./config/weather.json',
    ego='./config/vehicle.json',
)
```

## Using the Weather in the C++ Client

The [monoDrive C++ Client](../../cpp_client/cpp_quick_start) reads weather 
settings from input JSON files and sends them to the simulator. In the following
example, simply place the desired weather configuration into the file
`config/weather.json` and construct the simulator:

```c++
//Read JSON files in cpp_client/config directory
Configuration config(
    "config/simulator.json",
    "config/vehicle.json",
    "config/weather.json",
    "config/scenario.json"
);
Simulator& sim = Simulator::getInstance(config, "127.0.0.1", 8999);
```
