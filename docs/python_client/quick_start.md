# Python Quick Start

## Guide

The monoDrive Python Client is Open Source Software for connecting to and 
configuring the monoDrive Simulator and Scenario Editor. To get started 
make a [contact the NI monoDrive Team](https://www.monodrive.io/contact). 

### Installation

The monoDrive Python Client supports installation from git or locally with the 
cloned repository. It is recommended to install the client inside of a virtual 
environment such as `conda` (see instructions below), but this is not necessary. 

Install from Git repository:

```bash
$ pip install git+ssh://git@github.com/monoDriveIO/monodrive-python-client.git#egg=monodrive
```

or for https:

```bash
$ pip install git+https://github.com/monoDriveIO/monodrive-python-client.git#egg=monodrive
```

or, to install from a local repository:

```bash
$ cd /path/to/repo/monodrive-python-client
$ pip install -e .
```

### Recommended Environment

It is recommended to use the Anaconda distribution for creating virtual 
environments when using the monoDrive Python Client:

* [Anaconda for Python 3.7](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section)

After installation, the environment can be created using:

```bash
$ conda create --name monodrive-python
...
$ conda activate monodrive-python
```

Then follow the instructions above, to install the `monodrive` package with `pip`.

### Running Examples

The `examples` directory in the monoDrive Python Client repository contains 
several examples for connecting to a running instance of the 
[monoDrive Simulator](../Simulator.md) or 
[Scenario Editor](../scenario_editor/scenarios.md) and working with the simulation 
environment. To run an example, first ensure that the monoDrive Simulator is 
running or the monoDrive Scenario Editor is running and in "Play" mode.

```bash
$ conda activate monodrive-python
(monodrive-python) $ python examples/closed_loop.py
```
### Troubleshooting

- If the simulator is running on another machine, the host information in 
`examples/configuration/simulator.json` will need to be updated

```json
"simulator_ip": <IP OF SIMULATOR MACHINE>
```

- On running the script, the client is successfully connected if the simulator i
begins replaying the trajectory file.
