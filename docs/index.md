### Making autonomous vehicles drive safe
Generation of realistic scenarios and resulting sensor information for perception and planning system validation.
- Low latency networked vehicle control
- Parameterized vehicle dynamics models with run time physics modification
- Fast scenario regeneration, with super realtime replay
- Paramaterized and accurate real time sensor emulation

### HOW IT WORKS
monodrive’s platform is designed to automate scenario test generation for planning testing.
