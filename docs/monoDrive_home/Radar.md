# Radar

Provides Radar data from an electronically scanning Radar. This sensor is capable 
of producing a list of detected targets and the raw Radar data cube that was 
processed to produce the list.

The JSON portion of the Radar return contains ground truth and actual detected 
Radar returns. All arrays in the returns are indexed by target number (i.e. 
index 0 of `aoas` corresponds with index 0 of `ranges` and so on.)

- **game_time:** The time in seconds since the simulation started when this sample was acquired
- **message:** JSON containing the Radar return results
    - **gt_target_list:** JSON containing ground truth targets within the Radar range
        - **aoas:** Angle of arrival of each target in degrees
        - **ranges:** The range to each target in centimeters
        - **rcs:** The radial cross-section of the Radar return to each target
        - **target_ids:** The string representing the name of the actor that generated the target
        - **velocities:** The velocity in meters per second of each target
    - **target_list:** JSON containing the targets detected in the processed Radar signal
        - **aoas:** Angle of arrival of each target in degrees
        - **ranges:** The range to each target in centimeters
        - **rcs:** The radial cross-section of the Radar return to each target
        - **target_ids:** Array of target information for each target
            - **target_id:** The string representing the name of the actor that generated the target
        - **velocities:** The velocity in meters per second of each target
  **time:** The time in UTC seconds when this sample was acquired

### Radar Data Cube

The Radar data cube contains the complex values for each element in the 
[3D Radar cube](https://www.mathworks.com/help/phased/gs/radar-data-cube.html).

The data contains a binary array that is 

```bash
    Number of Sweeps  *  Number of Samples per Sweep  *  Number of Elements
```

in size. Each value in the array is two 32-bit floating point numbers 
representing the real and imaginary parts of each return value.
