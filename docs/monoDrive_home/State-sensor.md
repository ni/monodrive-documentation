# State

The state sensor is created during a simulation to  output state information for 
actors with the `"desired_tags"` and cull out information of actors with the 
`"undesired_tags"`. All the information for the actor is returned in the **global coordinate frame**.   

This information can be serialized to a monoDrive Trajectory File and played back in Replay Mode.

## Configuration

``` json
[
 {
   "type": "State",
   "listen_port": 8700,
   "rotation": {
      "pitch": 0.0,
      "roll": 0.0,
      "yaw": 0.0
   },
      "location": {
      "x": 0.0,
      "y": 0.0,
      "z": 0.0
   },
   "desired_tags": [
      "vehicle"
   ],
   "undesired_tags": [
      "static"
   ],
   "debug_drawing": false,
   "include_obb": true
}
]
```

- **desired_tags:** An array of actor tags to output with the state sensor. Any actor with these tags (and no tags in the `undesired_tags` array) will be output.
- **undesired_tags:** An array of actor tags to exclude from output. Any actor with one of these tags will not be included.
- **debug_drawing:** If true, and `include_obb` is true, the oriented bounding boxes for each actor in the output will be drawn.
- **include_obb:** If true, the oriented bounding box information will be included for every actor.
