## Configuration

### Configuration Tags
The monoDrive reports the EGO's acceleration in x, y and z axis. As well as the angular velocity in the same axis.  
The location and orientation of the sensor can be modified in the "x", "y" and "z" axis with respect to the car.

### Raw Output Data Format 

Following the data format found [here](http://files.microstrain.com/dcp/Inertia-Link-3DM-GX2-data-communications-protocol.pdf).
