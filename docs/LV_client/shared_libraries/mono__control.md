### Inputs
- **State Sensor sample(String):** The output of the state sensor. Corresponding to one frame of the simulation.
- **error in (Error Cluster):** Accepts error information wired from previously called VIs. This information can be used to decide if any functionality should be bypassed in the event of errors from other VIs.


### Outputs
- **Steering(DBL):** Steering value calculated by DLL to maintain the car on the right lane.
- **error out (Error Cluster):** Accepts error information wired from previously called VIs. This information can be used to decide if any functionality should be bypassed in the event of errors from other VIs.
