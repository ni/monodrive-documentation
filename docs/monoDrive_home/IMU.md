# IMU

Provides inertial measurements for the ego vehicle relative to the sensor's location.

## Configuration

```
[
  {
    "type": "IMU",
    "listen_port": 8500,
    "location": {
      "x":-75.0,
      "y":-25.0,
      "z":245.0
    },
    "rotation": {
      "pitch":0.0,
      "yaw":0.0,
      "roll":0.0
    }
  }

]
```

The monoDrive IMU sensor reports the ego vehicle's acceleration in x, y and z 
axis, as well as the angular velocity in the same axis. The location and 
orientation of the sensor can be modified in the "x", "y" and "z" axis with 
respect to the origin of the ego vehicle.

## Raw Output

The total sensor output is 48 bytes, where the first 12 bytes correspond to the 
monoDrive sensor header and the remaining 36 conform to the 3DM-GX2 Data 
Communications Protocol. The format for the protocal can be found 
[here](http://files.microstrain.com/dcp/Inertia-Link-3DM-GX2-data-communications-protocol.pdf). 
Below is a table of each element in the message:

| Byte  | Description   |
| ------------ | ------------ |
|Byte 0-1  | Start Byte |
|Bytes 1-5 | x acceleration bits represented as a float in single precision IEEE-754 format |
|Bytes 5-9 | y acceleration bits represented as a float in single precision IEEE-754 format |
|Byte 9-13 | z acceleration bits represented as a float in single precision IEEE-754 format |
|Bytes 13-17 | x angular velocity bits represented as a float in single precision IEEE-754 format |
|Bytes 17-21 | y angular velocity bits represented as a float in single precision IEEE-754 format |
|Bytes 21-25 | z angular velocity bits represented as a float in single precision IEEE-754 format |
|Bytes 25-29 | Timestamp as indicated in the above link |
|Bytes 29-31 | Checksum |
|Byte 31-35| Time of week |
